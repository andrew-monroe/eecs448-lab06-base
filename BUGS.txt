1. isEmpty() method always returns true.
2. addBack() actually adds to front (possibly a side effect of isEmpty() being broken?).
3. removeBack() does not decement size or remove a node (probably 
    because isEmpty() is always true, and it wouldn't remove from an empty list).
4. removeFront() does not decement size or remove a node (probably 
    because isEmpty() is always true, and it wouldn't remove from an empty list).
